# Customization

javelin IDE is configured with plain text files. There is no settings database, no sync and no network access:
everything below is a file you can read, edit, copy, back up or delete.

## Where settings live

| Layer | File | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User | Linux: `~/.config/javelin-ide/settings.conf` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/javelin-ide/`). macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/javelin-ide/settings.conf`. Windows: `%APPDATA%\javelin-ide\settings.conf` | Set `JAVELIN_IDE_CONFIG_DIR` to use another folder. |
| Project | `<project>/.javelin-ide/settings.conf` | Overrides the user layer for that project. Commit it to share it, or ignore the folder. |

Open either file from the **Settings** menu (it is created from a fully commented template on first use). Saving a
settings file inside javelin IDE applies it immediately; **Settings > Reload Settings** does the same on demand.
**Settings > Settings...** and **Project Settings...** are dialogs over the same files.

## File format

UTF-8, one `key=value` per line. Lines starting with `#` are comments. Values are taken exactly as written to the end
of the line, with no escape sequences, so `run.command=C:\tools\run.bat --fast` means what it says. Saving from a
dialog changes only the lines that changed; your comments, ordering and other entries are kept.

Problems (a line without `=`, a number out of range, an unknown action id) are listed in the Output panel and never stop
the editor from starting; the affected value falls back to its default.

## Settings

| Key | Default | Where | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `theme` | `light` | user only | `light`, `dark`, `high-contrast`, or a custom theme name (below). |
| `app.icon` | built-in icon | user only | Path to a PNG, JPEG or GIF used for the window, taskbar and macOS Dock icon (`~` is your home folder). A missing or unreadable file falls back to the built-in icon and says so in the status bar. |
| `editor.fontFamily` | `Monospaced` | user, project | Editor font. |
| `editor.fontSize` | `14` | user, project | 8 to 48. |
| `editor.tabSize` | `4` | user, project | 1 to 16. Used for Tab, auto-indent and Format Document. |
| `editor.insertSpaces` | `true` | user, project | Tab inserts spaces up to the next tab stop; `false` inserts a tab character. |
| `editor.wordWrap` | `false` | user, project | Wrap long lines. |
| `editor.lineNumbers` | `true` | user, project | Show the line-number gutter. |
| `editor.autoIndent` | `true` | user, project | Keep indentation on Enter, and indent after an opening bracket. |
| `run.command` | detected | user, project | Pre-filled into Run > Run Command...; you still confirm it. |
| `build.command` | detected | user, project | Replaces the detected command for Run > Build. The command is printed in Output when it runs. |
| `tree.exclude` | `.git,target` | user, project | Comma-separated names hidden from the project tree and Go to File. Write `tree.exclude=` to hide nothing. |
| `language.server.<id>` | suggestion | user, project | Pre-filled into Language > Start Language Server...; servers are still started only after you confirm. |
| `key.<action id>` | see below | user only | Keybinding override. |

`theme` and `key.*` are read from the user file only. A project cannot change your theme or shortcuts by being opened;
if a project file contains them they are ignored with a warning.

`build.command`, `run.command` and `language.server.*` in a project file are commands that came with the project. Treat
them like the project's own build scripts: read them before building a project you did not write.

View > Zoom In / Zoom Out / Reset Zoom change the font size for the current session only and are never saved.

## Themes

Built in: Light, Dark and High Contrast (View > Theme). To add your own, put a `.css` file in the `themes` folder next to
the user settings file; its name (without `.css`) becomes the theme name, and you select it from View > Theme or with
`theme=<name>`. Saving a theme file inside javelin IDE re-applies it.

A custom theme is an ordinary JavaFX stylesheet loaded after javelin IDE's own, so it can override anything. Put
`/* base: dark */` near the top to keep the dark theme's rules underneath and only change what you want:

```css
/* base: dark */
.root.theme-custom { -fx-base: #1b2630; -fx-background: #16202a; -fx-control-inner-background: #16202a; }
.theme-custom .code-area { -fx-background-color: #101922; }
.theme-custom .code-area .keyword { -fx-fill: #ffb454; }
```

Style classes you can rely on: `.code-area` with `.keyword`, `.type`, `.string`, `.comment`, `.annotation`, `.number`,
`.lineno`, `.diag-error`, `.diag-warning`; `.problem-error`, `.problem-warning`; `.popup-pane`. See `editor.css`.

## Keybindings

Every menu item is an action with an id. Override one with `key.<id>=<shortcut>` in the user file, or use
Settings > Settings... > Keybindings. Use `none` to remove a shortcut.

A shortcut is modifiers joined by `+`, then one key: `Ctrl+Shift+F`, `Alt+Z`, `F12`. Modifiers are `Ctrl`, `Shift`, `Alt`,
`Meta` and `Shortcut` (Ctrl on Windows/Linux, Cmd on macOS). Key names are JavaFX `KeyCode` names, case-insensitive:
letters, `DIGIT0`..`DIGIT9` (or just `0`..`9`), `F1`..`F12`, `COMMA`, `PERIOD`, `MINUS`, `EQUALS`, `BACK_QUOTE`, `SPACE`,
`ENTER`, `TAB`, and so on. In the dialog, any key other than a function key must be combined with Ctrl, Alt or Meta so a
shortcut cannot swallow normal typing. Two actions with the same shortcut are reported as a problem.

Every default that needs a command key is written with `Shortcut+`, so it is Cmd on macOS and Ctrl on Windows and
Linux: Save is Cmd+S / Ctrl+S, Search is Cmd+F / Ctrl+F, Build is Cmd+B / Ctrl+B, and so on. Function-key defaults (F2,
F3, F5, F12) are the same everywhere. Other File actions have no shortcut by default. To use a different one, for
example Ctrl+S even on macOS:

```
key.file.save=Ctrl+S
key.file.saveAs=Ctrl+Shift+S
```

`Shortcut+S` and `Ctrl+S` count as the same shortcut off macOS (and `Shortcut+S` equals `Cmd+S` on macOS) when
conflicts are checked.

Only menu actions are rebindable. Keys handled inside the text area itself (cursor movement, Ctrl+Z, copy and paste,
Ctrl+A) are not.
