/**
 * Mouse-gesture decisions for the project tree, kept free of JavaFX so they can be unit tested.
 *
 * <p>Two things made clicking in the tree unreliable:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Every row started a drag-and-drop as soon as the pointer moved a pixel or two between press and release.
 *       A drag swallows the click, so the item was not opened and a few clicks were "lost".</li>
 *   <li>Opening relied on the tree's selection at the moment of the second click instead of on the row that was
 *       actually clicked, so anything that changed the selection in between (a tree rebuild, a drag) opened or
 *       selected another file.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This class decides "was that a double-click on the same row?" from the presses themselves and "is this a real
 * drag?" from how far the pointer travelled, so neither depends on what JavaFX counted or selected.
