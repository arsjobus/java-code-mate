```

The interface should be familiar without being visually busy.

## Focus mode

Focus mode hides secondary panels and leaves the document as the primary surface. It is not a productivity scoring system.

## Navigation

Navigation should be fast and keyboard-friendly:
- Command palette
- Go to file
- Go to symbol
- Go to line
- Find
- Find in files

## AI

AI should not be a permanently open conversational surface. It should be invoked deliberately on a selection, document, project, or explicit task.

## Notifications

Notifications should be sparse and actionable. The editor should not use badges, feeds, or attention-grabbing alerts to create engagement.

## Configuration

Settings should be human-readable and exportable. The project should remain understandable outside the editor.
